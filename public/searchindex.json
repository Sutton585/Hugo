  "content":" Overview At ExhibitorLIVE 2018, Mirror Show Management (MSM) needed to cut through the noise of hundreds of exhibitors and capture high-quality leads. My challenge was to design an immersive experience that would not only stop attendees in their tracks but also compel them to engage and share their information.\nLeveraging my background in game design and UX, I led the creation of a multi-interface, RFID-enabled social gaming experience. This project was a unique opportunity to apply my passion for gamification and user experience design to a real-world business problem, creating a strategic tool that was both a centerpiece for the event and a powerful engine for lead generation.\nInnovative Gaming Experience To solve the challenges of attention, engagement, and lead capture, I designed and led the development of a board-game-inspired multiplayer game. The experience was built around a central, wall-sized game board that created a spectacle for players and spectators alike.\nParticipants used physical game pieces at individual touchscreen podiums to register via RFID game pieces, linking their gameplay directly to their contact information. During the game, the glass walls turned opaque, one of which was covered in a giant display, totally immersing players in a private session where they answered industry-specific, scenario-based questions. Every element—from gestural dice rolls to animated \u0026ldquo;chance\u0026rdquo; cards that offered an \u0026ldquo;MSM Saves the Day\u0026rdquo; lifeline—was designed to be memorable, reinforce MSM\u0026rsquo;s value proposition, and make the act of providing lead information a natural part of a fun, competitive experience.\nCapturing User Information Upon registration, players:\nChose a custom physical game piece that was registered via RFID. Entered their personal and business contact information, which populated the leaderboard and allowed for follow-up. This allowed MSM to collected valuable lead data while delivering a seamless, engaging user experience.\nImmersive Game Mechanics The entire experience was anchored by a central, wall-sized display that updated in real-time with player movements and scores, creating a focal point for both players and spectators. Key interactions were designed to be highly engaging, such as using gestural input to roll digital dice. The game also featured \u0026ldquo;chance\u0026rdquo; cards that introduced strategic risk, with a clever twist: players could use a special \u0026ldquo;MSM Saves the Day\u0026rdquo; card to negate negative effects. Hopefully this stuck as a memorable metaphor for MSM’s value proposition of turning challenges into opportunities.\nTailored, Scenario-Based Journeys The gameplay was designed to be a strategic reflection of MSM’s value. Players encountered a variety of themed question categories, each with distinct visuals to enhance clarity and engagement. These questions were not simple trivia; they were scenario-based interactions that required players to make strategic decisions mirroring real-world business challenges. This approach effectively showcased MSM’s ability to align solutions with client needs, turning a simple game into a powerful tool for setting the stage for meaningful, post-event conversations.\nConclusion The interactive gaming experience at ExhibitorLIVE 2018 showcased MSM’s ability to create cutting-edge, results-driven exhibits. By blending game design, advanced technology, and strategic engagement, this project demonstrated how innovation can transform event marketing into an unforgettable, data-driven success story.\nThe interactive exhibit was a resounding success, drawing significant crowds and generating consistent engagement throughout the event. More importantly, it transformed a standard trade show booth into a dynamic lead-generation platform.\nHigh-Quality Lead Capture: The registration process seamlessly collected valuable contact and business information, providing MSM\u0026rsquo;s sales team with a database of engaged prospects for targeted post-event outreach. Demonstrated Brand Value: The game mechanics and tailored, scenario-based questions effectively showcased MSM\u0026rsquo;s expertise in turning business challenges into opportunities, creating a memorable and shareable brand experience. Industry Acclaim: The project solidified MSM\u0026rsquo;s reputation for innovation, building on their previous award-winning presence at the event. This project reinforced my core belief that a cross-disciplinary approach, blending game design, UX, and technology, can create uniquely powerful user experiences. By aligning every feature with clear business objectives, we were able to deliver a project that was not only engaging but, most importantly, a measurable success.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

  "content":"Overview For the PepsiCo Partners trade show, my objective was to create an interactive multi-device touchscreen experience that would captivate attendees, showcase their new recurring order capabilities, and drive lead generation. I led the development of all digital and software aspects of the project, managing a cross-functional team of developers and designers to deliver a high-impact experience under a tight timeline. My role was to translate complex stakeholder requirements into an intuitive, engaging user journey, using rapid prototyping and iterative testing to ensure we met both business goals and user needs.\nThe Challenge \u0026amp; Goals The core challenge was to cut through the chaos of a crowded trade show floor. We had to achieve several key business goals:\nAnnounce and clearly demonstrate PepsiCo’s new recurring order capabilities. Design an experience so engaging it would convert attendees into customers. Seamlessly strengthen the sales funnel by directing users to on-site sales representatives. Accomplishing this meant simplifying complex product value propositions into digestible, intuitive interactions, all while navigating the significant constraints of a tight timeline and limited resources.\nMy Role I led the development of all digital and software-based aspects of this project, balancing a tight timeline with complex stakeholder requirements. My responsibilities spanned serval areas:\nIdeation and Strategy Facilitated brainstorming and storyboarding sessions to define the user journey and experience. Team Leadership Managed cross-functional teams of developers and designers, ensuring seamless communication and delivery on an aggressive schedule. Stakeholder Engagement Presented prototypes, articulated design decisions, and maintained transparency with clients and internal teams. Iterative Testing Guided the project through multiple design iterations based on user feedback, ensuring alignment with client goals and user needs. Iterative Design and Refinement The entire experience was built on a foundation of rapid iteration and refinement. The screen flow underwent multiple cycles of testing, allowing us to seamlessly integrate animations, user workflows, and clear calls to action. We prototyped every key interaction, from the frictionless contact capture screen to the step-by-step simulations of the new recurring order feature. Four key value propositions were brought to life with custom animations controlled by user touch gestures, ensuring that every element was not only intuitive but also visually engaging.\nWire-framing and Storyboarding The project began by creating low-fidelity wireframes and storyboards that served as our strategic blueprint. These initial visualizations mapped every step of the user journey, from the first touchpoint to the final handoff to a sales representative, ensuring every interaction had a clear purpose.\nSimplifying the Complex With our strategy mapped, we transformed the standard ordering process into a guided, interactive walkthrough. This allowed users to simulate placing and managing recurring orders step-by-step, clearly demonstrating the platform\u0026rsquo;s ease of use and value in a live, hands-on environment.\nTactile Interactivity Finally, to make the experience memorable, we layered in polished, custom animations controlled by touch. A standout feature allowed users to swipe to transition from day to night, providing a moment of tactile delight that showcased the platform\u0026rsquo;s responsive and engaging nature.\nEnd Result The exhibit was a definitive success, cutting through the trade show noise to attract high foot traffic. Visitors praised the intuitive, tactile design, and this high level of engagement directly translated into more meaningful conversations with sales reps, strengthening the overall sales funnel.\nThis project is a clear example of how a focused, user-centered design process can deliver an impactful experience, even under the pressure of a tight timeline. By grounding our creative animations and interactive workflows in rapid prototyping and iterative testing, we ensured every element served the core business goals. The key takeaway for me was clear: in a fast-paced environment, an agile and collaborative process is the foundation for creating engaging experiences that deliver measurable results\n"},{

  "content":"An agency\u0026rsquo;s vision to solve post-COVID healthcare staffing chaos died on arrival when their expensive, externally-built MVP was delivered non-functional. I was brought in as the product design leader to rescue the project from the ground up. With no product leadership, significant technical debt, and a bloated, rapidly-scaling engineering team, I executed a two-front strategy: first, I ran an iterative research and design process to find the core user need and validate a new product direction. Second, I built a scalable DesignOps system to ensure we could execute on that vision with speed and consistency. This work became the cornerstone of WAE, the new startup that went on to provide countless employment opportunities to underserved communities.\nEngineering-Led Project Burning Cash Without formal product leadership, the project was led by a rapidly scaling engineering team. This resulted in fragmented workflows, misaligned priorities, and a lack of accountability. With UX and product strategy under-resourced, engineering resources were being squandered on low-impact features, and traditional handoffs between design and development created unpredictable delays, leaving no room for iteration based on user feedback.\nSolution I introduced a two-part solution to fix both the organizational structure and the day-to-day workflow while ensuring a collaborative, user-centered design strategy.\nFirst, I implemented the “three-in-a-box” leadership model, which created a balanced partnership between Product, Engineering, and UX. This elevated UX to an equal partner, ensuring decisions were user-centered and data-informed while giving engineering a clear, strategic roadmap to execute against.\nWith the right structure and accountability in place, I then rolled out a dual-track agile framework for UX. This created two parallel workflows operating every sprint:\nDiscovery Track: Focused entirely on understanding user needs through research, rapid prototyping, and stakeholder workshops. This track validated ideas before they entered development. Delivery Track: Focused on building and launching the solutions that were validated in the discovery track, using prototypes as a shared language to ensure clarity between design and engineering. Impact This new operating system completely transformed how the teams worked together. The \u0026ldquo;three-in-a-box\u0026rdquo; model created clear ownership and alignment, while dual-track agile eliminated wasteful cycles. We were no longer building features on assumptions; we could validate ideas early, reduce rework, and create a seamless, collaborative environment where user empathy drove a data-informed process.\nPoor Systems = Unscalable Rework With siloed teams, informal requirements, and ambiguous approvals, our product direction was inconsistent. I was caught in a cycle of rapid iteration as new requirements surfaced mid-development, leading to wasted effort and a disjointed user experience. We needed a consistent design language and a reliable system to drive cross-functional alignment.\nSolution I designed and implemented a centralized DesignOps engine as the single source of truth for the entire organization. The system\u0026rsquo;s core consisted of two interconnected parts:\nThe Design System: A scalable framework built in Figma using atomic design principles, precise naming conventions, and nested variants. This toolkit of reusable components and patterns eliminated inconsistency and drastically reduced development time. The Living Documentation Hub: This collaborative wiki served as our operational playbook, linking everything from interactive Figma prototypes and user research to live Jira tickets. By making this hub the center of all product discussions, we created a seamless, traceable system from initial concept to final deployment. This engine culminated in a frictionless handoff process where any approved change to a master component cascaded through the entire system in real-time. Developers accessed dedicated, annotated files, confident they were always building from the most current, validated design.\nImpact This integrated system became the team\u0026rsquo;s secret weapon for creating alignment and buy-in. A senior developer called it \u0026ldquo;the best design documentation he\u0026rsquo;d ever seen.\u0026rdquo; The system eliminated ambiguity, accelerated onboarding from weeks to days, and created a predictable, scalable machine for turning user needs into revenue-generating features.\nExample from the initial MVP that needed to be redesigned and completely rebuilt.\nRebuilding Stakeholder Confidence Since I was brought on in response to the company\u0026rsquo;s initial failed MVP, I knew a product designed in that same vacuum couldn\u0026rsquo;t succeed. My mission was to establish a product design strategy using real user data, rebuild stakeholder confidence, and ensure that when we launched, we had customers ready to adopt and pay.\nSolution Before we could validate any features, we first had to establish a clear product vision to rally stakeholders. I led a competitive analysis that revealed our two distinct user segments (healthcare professionals and general laborers) had very different needs but a shared desire for a platform they could trust.\nFrom this, I established our guiding product principle or \u0026ldquo;North Star\u0026rdquo;: Reliability and Relatability. Every design and product decision had to answer two questions: Does this feel as trustworthy as a banking app? And does it feel as approachable and human as a modern consumer app? This North Star became the foundation for rebuilding confidence and aligning the entire product strategy.\nWith this vision in place, I designed an iterative testing process that served two functions simultaneously: executing on that vision while cultivating our first adopters.\nUser-testing Validation Loop Using rapid, interactive prototypes, I ran a continuous feedback loop to refine the product in real time. This de-risked development by ensuring every design decision was grounded in direct evidence of solving a real user problem, not just internal assumptions. We quickly identified that redundant data entry, manual scheduling bottlenecks, and high error rates were the most critical pain points and would be the primary targets for our MVP. Measuring against these would provide clear validation of our success.\nNew Sales Pipeline I then reached out to sales department leaders to help select key potential clients to participate in these strategic testing sessions. The framing was critical: this was an exclusive opportunity for them to co-create the future of their industry. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t just asking for feedback for our product; I was showing them a future where our technology would give them an unmatched, seamless end-to-endUX. This was their chance to have a hand in the creation of a tool being custom-built for their specific needs.\nI reached out to sales department leaders to help select key potential clients for these strategic testing sessions. These clients\u0026rsquo; time and input was very valuable, so the framing was critical: I wasn\u0026rsquo;t just asking for feedback, this was an exclusive opportunity for them to co-create the future of their industry with us. I was showing them a future where our technology would provide them an unmatched, seamless end-to-end experience. This was their chance to help create a tool custom-built for their specific needs.\nImpact This strategy transformed our research process into a powerful sales and marketing engine. The internal loop ensured we built the right product to solve high-value problems. The external loop turned passive prospects into invested partners. By the time we launched, we didn\u0026rsquo;t just have a validated product; we had a cohort of advocates who felt a sense of ownership and were already sold on its success.\nProgress: Iteratively designing and testing every flow with real users from day one.\nCore Innovation To Spark Adoption My initial research uncovered pain points like redundant data entry and manual email workflows. However, workshops and competitive analysis revealed that the real crisis for our users was the compounding complexity of scheduling large, recurring jobs. While competitors handled one-off tasks, they all failed at bulk shift scheduling, creating massive manual bottlenecks. This was a huge feature gap and the highest-value problem we could solve.\nSolution I initiated a rapid design and testing cycle centered on this core problem, learning about the current inefficient workflows involving emailing spreadsheets. My hypothesis was that our solution could feel intuitive by using UI and interaction patterns similar to the spreadsheets our users were already familiar with.\nI built a series of interactive prototypes and tested them iteratively with real clients and end-users, gathering feedback to validate and refine the design with each cycle. This process allowed us to test our core assumptions and co-create the solution with the very people who would use it every day.\nThe feedback from these cycles directly shaped the app\u0026rsquo;s standout feature. Rather than force users into a rigid new system, we built a flexible one that mirrored their mental models. The final design included:\nA flexible spreadsheet-like interface that replicated users\u0026rsquo; familiar tabular workflows, making complex data entry feel intuitive. Auto-fill and customizable templates that streamlined repetitive tasks and allowed users to adapt the tool to their unique shift requirements. An automated import feature to support clients still relying on spreadsheet-based workflows. Impact The results were immediate and dramatic. This single feature, born from iterative testing, became the core of our value proposition. Users reported a 50% reduction in the time it took to schedule large jobs, and average user satisfaction scores for the task increased from 52% to 96%. It was so effective that users consistently described it as a “game changer” for their daily operations.\nFinal Outcome I knew from the start I\u0026rsquo;d be doing a rescue on this product, but it ended up being a ground-up business transformation. We started with a non-functional MVP, a misaligned team burning cash, and hemoraging stakeholder confidence. We ended with a market-validated product, a cohort of pre-sold advocates, and a scalable operational backbone designed for future growth.\nThe core results of this turnaround were:\nA \u0026ldquo;Game Changer\u0026rdquo; Feature: By identifying and solving the highest-value user problem, we cut scheduling time by 50% and increased user satisfaction from 52% to 96%, creating the core innovation needed for market adoption. A Scalable Operating System: The DesignOps engine and agile frameworks eliminated rework and created a predictable path from idea to deployment. The system was so effective that a senior developer called the documentation \u0026ldquo;the best he\u0026rsquo;d ever seen.\u0026rdquo; A De-Risked Business Strategy: We transformed the research process into a pre-sales pipeline, building a base of invested customers who felt ownership of the product before it even launched. Ultimately, the most significant deliverable wasn\u0026rsquo;t just the WAE platform. It was the installation of a durable, repeatable engine for turning user needs into revenue. By fixing the operational chaos first, we had the foundation that made strategic innovation possible, ensuring the company was positioned not just to launch, but to lead.

  "content":" Interactive UI Demo Overview I was brought into Xerox\u0026rsquo;s Experience Design Group to lead the UX/UI design for their next-generation of devices, with the mission of transforming the legacy multifunction printer (MFP) interface into an intuitive, mobile-like experience.\nIt became immediately clear, that this vision was limited by a broken internal system: a waterfall development process crippled by slow validation cycles, massive rework costs, and an increasingly strained relationship between our US-based stakeholders and offshore developers. To deliver an innovative product, I had to address the underlying dysfunction in the process. I developed, advocated for, and implemented a more modern DesignOps framework that solved these underlying business and delivery challenges. This new system cleared the path to not only launch the product but to establish it as an industry benchmark for usability, winning multiple awards and proving that a great process is what creates a great product.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Vision Versus Reality The mission was to deliver a world-class, gesture-based UI that mirrored the usability of a mobile device. This required rapid iteration, user-centric feedback, and tight collaboration.\nHowever, the existing operational reality made this impossible. The vision was blocked by three critical failures:\nMassive Rework Costs: Ambiguous handoffs and language barriers with the offshore development team led to constant issues with interpretation. At least one week out of every month was lost to preventable rework, directly threatening project timelines and straining key stakeholder relationships. Glacial Speed-to-Market: The existing \u0026ldquo;waterfall\u0026rdquo; validation process treated user testing as a final, monolithic step that took months to complete. This prevented quick feedback on core concepts and baked immense risk into every unvalidated design decision. Cultural Inertia: A deep-seated \u0026ldquo;this is how we\u0026rsquo;ve always done it\u0026rdquo; mentality created considerable institutional resistance to the more modern workflows and best practices we would need to build innovative, modern user experience. To achieve our product vision, we had to first tear down the broken legacy system that was holding it hostage.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Solution: An Ops-First System My solution was not just a set of wireframes; it was a new operational model designed specifically to overcome these obstacles. It was built on two pillars:\n1. Design Documentation as the Source of Truth I advocated a new standard for UI/UX documentation that served as an unambiguous contract between design, product, and engineering. It was a comprehensive system detailing every interaction, state, and workflow for our mobile-like UI.\nFunction: It eliminated the guesswork and communication gaps with the offshore team, which was the root cause of rework. Result: This system became the anchor for all decisions, forcing clarity and alignment around the product vision. 2. Building Faster, Testing More I demonstrated how to overhaul the slow, monolithic user acceptance testing workflows with a system of rapid, targeted validation. The legacy method involved fully building UI components with the already-strained development team, then scripting extensive, multi-month research studies that measured broad \u0026ldquo;task success\u0026rdquo; rates.\nMy new process used modern prototyping tools to isolate and test specific, high-risk assumptions. Instead of building an entire feature, we could create targeted high-fidelity prototypes to validate a single critical interaction in a matter of days. This shifted our approach from a slow, expensive post-mortem to a fast, cheap, and continuous feedback loop.\nFunction: This provided a constant stream of actionable user feedback, allowing us to validate or kill ideas before writing a single line of production code. Result: It systematically de-risked the project and, by demonstrating quick, tangible progress, converted skeptical stakeholders into advocates for the new process.

It removed the operational friction and unleashed the design team\u0026rsquo;s ability to execute on the original vision.\nIndustry Recognition and Best-in-Class Usability We successfully delivered the intuitive, tablet-like experience we set out to build. The redesigned ConnectKey UI was a massive commercial and critical success, receiving widespread acclaim and multiple industry awards for its usability and innovative design.\nAwards from Buyer\u0026rsquo;s Lab, McAffee, iF Design, CRN, and others:\nBLI 2018 Monochrome Printer \u0026amp; MFP Line of the Year Award 2020 Buyers Lab Pick Award for the innovative App Gallery ecosystem 2021-2022 PaceSetter Award for leadership in hybrid workplace solutions The Business Results That Made It Possible This award-winning product was the direct result of the new operational efficiency we created:\nReduced Rework by at least 25%: The documentation system saved thousands of developer hours and dramatically accelerated the timeline. Cut Testing Cycles from Months to Weeks: Rapid prototyping allowed for more iteration, leading to a higher-quality product shipped faster. Improved Developer Velocity: The clear, systematic approach gave the offshore team the predictability they needed to perform at their best. Your browser does not support the video tag. Lessons Learned This experience at Xerox helped clarify my philosophy: exceptional outcomes come from intentional systems. It was an early inflection point in my career where I realized my background as a developer in high-velocity projects gave me an advantage when it came to getting results in challenging environments.\nThis project also helped me refine my approach and deepen my toolkit. I was able to use rapid prototyping as a gas pedal to accelerate the development process, expedite informed stakeholder alignment and focus our direction. My ability to quickly build and drive communication and collaboration provided clarity and focus for developers, targetted high-velocity testing cycles, and collaborative stakeholders armed with with tangible proof of progress and user-acceptance. Turning my technical expertise to strategic problems helped me develop the playbook I still use to drive results in challenging turnaround scenarios.\n"}]
